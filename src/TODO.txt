TODO

- test if we can move outputpass vertex shader to @group(1)
- add expire frame lifetime to all cache resources (pipelines, etc)
  - want to prevent memory leak from say CHydra building new shaders every frame
- remove R_Binding->generation

- add dt to FrameUniforms
- add gamma and per-channel gamma to OutputPass (so u can replicate the Matrix color curve)
- create defines.h, put compilation constants like MATERIAL_MAX_BINDINGS there
- add inverse normal matrix to PER_DRAW instanced draw uniforms
- change RenderPass to ScenePass
- add shader debug info to release build (perhaps as an option in ShaderDef struct field)
- group all the commands of the frame together, submit all at once at end of RenderGraph 


- there is a slow leak somewhere (500kb / min)
  - check if this happens with just chuck (no chugl gg.nextFrame())
  - check if happens with just empty gameloop
  - check if happens with just an event being fired every frame, but no chugl
  - if it happens on empty gameloop and NOT any of the chuck-only tests
    - add logging to arena reallocation, check if I'm forgetting to clear any of the arenas
      - not picked up by xcode leakcheck, suggests its coming from an arena resize
      - but the linear growth of the leak suggests its *not* an arena, because arenas double every time in size
        - but maybe the memory is only picked up by tracker when writing/reading??? (i believe this ithe case on windows, so you can init an arena to several gigs no problem, see ryan fleury post)
        - 
  -  ==Address all of this as part of the great chugl garbage collection refactor==
     -  other resources to look at:
        -  how does box2c track memory? look at their API for requesting memory usage
           -  ideally ChuGL can do the same
