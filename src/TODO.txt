TODO

- test if we can move outputpass vertex shader to @group(1)
- add expire frame lifetime to all cache resources (pipelines, etc)
  - want to prevent memory leak from say CHydra building new shaders every frame

- add dt to FrameUniforms
- add gamma and per-channel gamma to OutputPass (so u can replicate the Matrix color curve)
- create defines.h, put compilation constants like MATERIAL_MAX_BINDINGS there
- add inverse normal matrix to PER_DRAW instanced draw uniforms
- change RenderPass to ScenePass
- add shader debug info to release build (perhaps as an option in ShaderDef struct field)
- group all the commands of the frame together, submit all at once at end of RenderGraph
