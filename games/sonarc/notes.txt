# Screens


# Stages/Modes
- racetrack
    - simple indie500 shape, but add obstacles
    - first to finish wins
- platformer, jump over the gaps to get to other side
    - if you fall off, respawn at start
    - mic level moves forward (can't move backwards lol)
    - any key to jump
    - procedurally generate
    - allow multiple "winners" if multiple get to end platform on same frame
- flappy bird side scroll dodge
    - volume makes you go up
    - gravity naturally pulls you down
- raft going up, dodge obstacles coming down
    - maybe use spectrum centroid for this one--higher goes right, lower goes left
    - visualize spectrum at bottom of screen?
- hot potato
    - volume burns down /accelerates the fuse 
    - what if there are multiple bombs?
    - or maybe the person with bomb is fast and has to tag the others to pass it on
        - makes sense then why people would be yelling, to trigger bomb-holder to explode
    - q: do you get to pick who you throw it to? or is the target player random? 
    - design q: do we show the remaining time on the bomb? or is it random / invisible?
        - probably not, then it's just a reaction speed check
- sound pumps/fills a balloon...
    - the person who pops the balloon is eliminated
- something to do with visual of waveform, maybe a dodging laser game
    - side scroll, go from left to right
    - making sound above threshold activates top-down vertica lasers
- Sports games
    - golf? make fun of how quiet it typically is. Also, unlike switch sports, no
      waiting for your turn! that's boring. Everyone is golfing / making sound at 
      same time.
    - Tennis? make fun of how loudly they grunt when hitting
- games that play off making loud noises in public spaces
    - studying in library
    - sneaking/sleuthing/stealth (maybe cat hunting a mouse?)
- Lip / soundwave bullet hell
    - similar to tiny towers TD
    - making sound activates bullets / towers, but those bullets damage everybody
    - loudspeaker pickup that lets you fire bullets / sound waves too
    - or maybe dodging spikes on a spectrum...
- snowball fight
    - volume charges up a snowball, can throw at enemy
- rhythm game
- a game where everyone yells at same time would be funny (like temple run) 
  but everyone is rounding corners at same time?
- doodle jump??
- microphone pickup, only the player holding the mic receives (or is immune) to the 
  effect of the audio
- timing game where you *don't* want to make sound unless its a very specific time
- inspo sources
    - fusion frenzy!
    - mario party
    - intentionally *not* playing warioware so I can explore this space as a clean slate

# Core Gameplay 
- audio is a double-edged sword. because everyone shares the same mic input, leads to 
a weird coupled-chaotic system....
- maybe the key is there needs to be a tension when using audio
    - timing: you need to use audio at the right time, but that time is different for
    each player so you have to stay vigilant...
    - double-edged sword: (e.g. in arc battle) increasing volume screws your opponents over
    but it also makes the game more challenging for yourself
- every game needs to be playable by any number of players, so cannot have e.g. 2v2 type games 
- players can influence the game *after* they have died, no boring downtime while waiting
  for others to finish
- for tracking wins/points, do the simplest first:
    - just track # of wins (that way don't need to have a system for quantifying points / 
    places for lower places)
    - game ends when first player get X wins
- any game needs to be playable with just 2 keyboard keys? (for people who don't have controllers)

- can the replay mechanic somehow influence the actual gameplay?

# Mic Input (What can we reliably (or unreliably) get from mic input?)
- make a playground editor to test / visualize
- speech recognition (look @ you, Mage Arena)
- pitch tracking (?)
- volume (YES)
- spectral center (for a very rough high vs low pitch)
- hi-pass or low-pass or band-pass + any of the other features (pitch, volume, centroid)
- look at UAnas for more

# Ideas
- At the end of each stage, have an (optional) replay
    - a volume bar that starts at 50%, if you fill it up with sound it selects YES + replay, 
    else NO and move onto next stage
- coop vs competitive: is there room to have both game modes?
    - only competitive for now
- should all modes be 4 players on same screen, or in some modes does each player have own viewport?
    - simple: all on same screen. that way can support an odd number of players or > 4.

# Visuals
- remember: keep it as shitty as possible for as long as possible
- characters: 4 different colors, all triangles
    - distinguish with mic-input "sound effect" 
        - use LiSa to record your own, or select from a preset 
        (sonic equivalent of picking a skin / color theme)
        - can combine with pitshift for funny
- eventually can move to rounded/soft vector graphics with drop shadows
